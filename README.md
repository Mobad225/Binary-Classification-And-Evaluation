Used MNIST Dataset to familiarize with binary classification using OvR (One vs Rest) classification.
Tried SGD Classifier vs Random Forest Classifier to classify 8 images vs non-8 images.

Used Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) & Confusion Matrices to Evaluate the results.
Visualized the precision/recall tradeoff and used AUC of ROC for evaluation as well.
